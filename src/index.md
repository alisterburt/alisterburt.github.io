# About me

Hey! Thanks for stopping by.

My name is **Alister Burt**, I'm a 28-year-old imaging scientist currently
living in Oxford, UK. I develop image analysis software enabling *in situ*
structural biology.

In my day job we use extremely noisy images
from an electron microscope to understand biology. I currently work in
[David Barford](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/a-to-g/david-barford/)
's group at the
[MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/).

I also work with an amazing group of people on
[napari üèùÔ∏è](https://napari.org/),
an extensible, interactive multidimensional image viewer for Python.

I'm generally excited about image analysis for cryo-electron tomography and
care about sustainablility in scientific software development.
